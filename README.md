Homer Dashboard with Nord Palette

This is my customized version of the Homer Dashboard using Nord Color Palette.

All colors and card edits are done in the config.yml file.   This Homer configuration only uses the "Dark Colors" of Homer.  The "Light Colors" settings are all default.

All icons used are located in the /tools folders.
